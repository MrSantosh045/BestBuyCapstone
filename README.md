# E-Commerce Project: Automated Testing of Best Buy E-Commerce Website

## Project Title: 
**Automated Testing of the Best Buy E-Commerce Website**

## Project Overview:
This project aims to build an automated testing system for the Best Buy e-commerce website. Using Selenium for browser automation, the system will simulate a user's actions on the website, such as navigating menus, adding products to the cart, and completing purchases. The goal is to verify that the website behaves as expected across various functionalities, both positive and negative scenarios.

## Test Objective:
The objective is to automate testing of the **Best Buy e-commerce website** (https://www.bestbuy.com/) by writing scripts to:
- Validate core functionalities like navigation, shopping cart, and checkout process.
- Test for broken links and site reliability.
- Ensure that the order flow functions smoothly, including handling different user scenarios like invalid payment information and product search.

## Precondition:
- The user is logged in with access to the booking feature.

## Test Cases:
The project will include test cases that cover all positive and negative scenarios, such as successful login, incorrect credentials, and placing valid and invalid orders.

### Demo URL:
Testing will be performed on the following URL: **[Best Buy Website](https://www.bestbuy.com/)**

13. **Automated Test Suite**: 
   - Schedule and run the test suite automatically on a regular basis.

14. **Testing Framework**: 
   - Use **JUnit** or **TestNG** to organize and execute the tests.

15. **Continuous Integration**: 
   - Use **Jenkins** to automate tests when new code is pushed to the repository.

16. **Comprehensive Testing**: 
   - Cover as much of the site’s functionality as possible, such as search filters and account creation.

17. **Error Handling**: 
   - Ensure the system handles errors, such as invalid product selections and payment issues.

18. **Selenium Workflows**: 
   - Use Selenium workflows such as Action Classes, Window Handles, Frames, Alerts, and Dynamic Xpath handling.

19. **Cross-Browser Testing**: 
   - Ensure compatibility across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox).

20. **Optional Headless Mode**: 
   - Use **Headless Chrome** to run tests without displaying the browser.

21. **Screenshots**:
