In this Project, I have created a maven Project, to Launch the BestBuy Website and automated few testcases.
I have automated the Testcases, using Java and Selenium.
Here, I have used the Utils class to have all the commonly used functions.
In the Base class, I have used the TestNG annotations, as per needed for the TestSuite to run.
For each page I have created a class and located the elements and written the methods that is needed.
For each Test, I have created Test methods as needed.

The following are the testcases:

TC001_SignUp - Validating the SignUp page of the BestBuy website.
TC002_accountLogin -Validating the login page of the BestBuy website.
TC003_checkBrokenUrl - Checking if the BestBuy website url is broken or not.
TC004_menuLinksNavigation - Checking the menus links on the Best buy homepage.
